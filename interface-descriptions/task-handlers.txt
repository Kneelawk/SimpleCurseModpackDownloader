How should task handlers work?

TaskHandlers are supposed to be responsible for restarting crashed/zombie killed tasks.

How should a TaskHandler know a task has crashed?
Through events?

The thing with events is that events are called in the same thread as they're fired. And they're all called sequentially.
This means that if i restart a blocking task (one that happens all in the start function) then none of the other listeners
will get called.

Maybe I should use an ExecutionContext to help with this?

This also means that all updated variables in a task should actually be atomic.

Should task handlers have an await sort of thing?
