How should zombie killers work.
Should there be one zombie killer that goes through a giant list of all running tasks
and kills any unresponsive ones? If so, should the zombie killer be responsibile for restarting them?
How would a restarted task behave? Would it be able to know about it's parents? Would it need to clean up resources?
Would restarting a killed zombie task be as easy as calling startTask() on it after it had been interrupted?
Should tasks have a specialized method called restartTask() for restarting crashed or zombie tasks? This method
could possible just call startTask() by default unless overridden. Granted, a crashed or killed zombie task would have its
state set to crashed/zombie killed when startTask() was called so it could be able to tell from that.

This would mean that any corruptible resources should only be created once startTask() has been called and should be cleaned
up when the task is interrupted.
