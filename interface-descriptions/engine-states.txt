Should engine states have states for when they're stopping but not quite stopped yet?

Things like a KillingZombie state to indicate that the task has received the ZombieKill interrupt, but isn't completely
shut down yet?

Should this apply just to zombie kills or should it apply to other things as well?

Maybe just the states that are caused by interrupts then?
