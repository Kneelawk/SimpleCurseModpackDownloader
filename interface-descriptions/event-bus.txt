The event bus sends a start signal to its creator.
The event bus can have event listeners registered with it.
When an event bus receives an event, it notifies all event listeners listening for that type of event.
Events can be anything, usually case classes.

QUESION: Should I try to make sure event busses are type-specified.
Type-specified event busses would be individual classes for each set of events.
Type-specified event busses would likely require macros for ease of creation.

Pros of type-specified event busses:
Event type safety.
You know what possible events can be fired.

Cons of type-specified event busses:
Seperate classes for each set of events.
Requires macros for non-tedious implementation.
